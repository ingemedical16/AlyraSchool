# Programming Bitcoin with BitcoinJS and Bitcoin Core CLI

Welcome to the extensive guide to Bitcoin Javascript!
In this guide we will explain how to create various types of Bitcoin transactions, using the 
[BitcoinJS](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib) library. 

We will use the Bitcoin Core command-line interface in Regtest mode for various common tasks, as well as some 
complementary libraries like `bx` aka [Libbitcoin Explorer](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer).

Throughout this guide, we want to provide you with sufficient explanation to each command to understand it without drowning 
in information. You can refer to additional resources to better understand the Bitcoin protocol. 
For example, check out our [Bitcoin Studio presentations](https://www.bitcoin-studio.com/resources).

At the moment, Bitcoin Javascript tutorials are still very scarce, but we believe it doesn't have to be this way. 
The following guide intends to address this problem. 


## Requirements

Having prior theoretical knowledge of the Bitcoin protocol will surely help, but we provide comprehensive explanation 
throughout this guide so it fits for beginners.  

Technical requirements
* Node v10 recommended
* BitcoinJS v4
* Bitcoin Core v18
* Bash or a Bash interpreter like Cygwin or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
* Libbitcoin Explorer v3 (optional)
