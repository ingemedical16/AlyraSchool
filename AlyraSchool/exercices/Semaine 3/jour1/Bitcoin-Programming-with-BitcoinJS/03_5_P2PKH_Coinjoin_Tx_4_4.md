# 3.5: Coinjoin Transaction (4 inputs, 4 outputs) - Legacy P2PKH

> To follow along this tutorial
> * Execute all the transaction code in one go by typing `node code/filename.js`   
> * Or enter the commands step-by-step by `cd` into `./code` then type `node` in a terminal to open the Node.js REPL   
> * Open the Bitcoin Core GUI console or use `bitcoin-cli` for the Bitcoin Core commands

## What is Coinjoin

The signatures, one per input, inside a transaction are completely independent of each other. This means that it's 
possible for Bitcoin users to agree on a set of inputs to spend, and a set of outputs to pay to, and then to individually 
and separately sign a transaction and later merge their signatures. The transaction is not valid and won't be accepted 
by the network until all signatures are provided, and no one will sign a transaction which is not to their liking.

To use this to increase privacy, the N users would agree on a uniform output size and provide inputs amounting to at 
least that size. The transaction would have N outputs of that size and potentially N more change outputs if some of the 
users provided input in excess of the target. All would sign the transaction, and then the transaction could be transmitted. 
No risk of theft at any point.

Consider the following transactions made at the same time: A purchases an item from B, C purchases an item from D, and E 
purchases an item from F. Without Coinjoin, the public blockchain ledger would record three separate transactions for 
each input-output match. With Coinjoin, only one single transaction is recorded. The ledger would show that bitcoins 
were paid from A, C, and E addresses to B, D, and F. By masking the deals made by all parties, an observer canâ€™t, with 
full certainty, determine who sent bitcoins to whom.

## What we will do

Let's create a Coinjoin transaction mixing four different transactions. 

We will do the following: 
  * Alice_1    -> Bob_1
  * Carol_1    -> Dave_1
  * Eve_1      -> Mallory_2
  * Mallory_1  -> Alice_2 

The four signers agree on a uniform output amount of 0.2 BTC.  

We will create four UTXOs to spend from, with different amounts but with at least 0.2 BTC. If someone spend a UTXO that
is more than 0.2 BTC, we will create a additional output for his change. 


## Create UTXOs to spend from

Import libraries, test wallets and set the network
```javascript
const bitcoin = require('bitcoinjs-lib')
const { alice, bob, carol, dave, eve, mallory } = require('./wallets.json')
const network = bitcoin.networks.regtest
```

First let's create four UTXOs with a single transaction.
> Send 0.2 BTC to alice_1 P2PKH address.       
> Send 0.2 BTC to carol_1 P2PKH address.   
> Send 0.25 BTC to eve_1 P2PKH address.   
> Send 0.3 BTC to mallory_1 P2PKH address.   
```
$ sendmany "" '{"n4SvybJicv79X1Uc4o3fYXWGwXadA53FSq":0.2, "mh1HAVWhKkzcvF41MNRKfakVvPV2sfaf3R":0.2, "mqbYBESF4bib4VTmsqe6twxMDKtVpeeJpt":0.25, "mwkyEhauZdkziHJijx9rwZgShr9gYi9Hkh": 0.3}'
```

Generate a block to dave_1 P2WPKH address.
```
$ generatetoaddress 1 bcrt1qnqud2pjfpkqrnfzxy4kp5g98r8v886wgvs9e7r
```

Then we need to know which UTXO corresponds to which address
Get the output indexes (vout) of the transaction, so that we have the four outpoints (txid / vout).
> Find the output index (or vout) under `details > vout`.
```
$ gettransaction "txid"
``` 

We can also check UTXOs of specific addresses.
```
$ scantxoutset start '["addr(n4SvybJicv79X1Uc4o3fYXWGwXadA53FSq)", "addr(mh1HAVWhKkzcvF41MNRKfakVvPV2sfaf3R)", "addr(mqbYBESF4bib4VTmsqe6twxMDKtVpeeJpt)", "addr(mwkyEhauZdkziHJijx9rwZgShr9gYi9Hkh)"]'
``` 


## Creating the Coinjoin transaction

Now let's spend the UTXOs and create four new ones.
A facilitator, let's say alice_1, will create the transaction, sign his input, then pass the partially-signed transaction 
to the next participant and so on until everybody has signed and someone broadcast it.

Create a key pair for each spender (alice_1, carol_1, eve_1, mallory_1), so that they can sign. 
```javascript
const keyPairAlice1 = bitcoin.ECPair.fromWIF(alice[1].wif, network)
const keyPairCarol1 = bitcoin.ECPair.fromWIF(carol[1].wif, network)
const keyPairEve1 = bitcoin.ECPair.fromWIF(eve[1].wif, network)
const keyPairMallory1 = bitcoin.ECPair.fromWIF(mallory[1].wif, network)
```

Create an address for each recipient (bob_1, dave_1, mallory_2, alice_2), so that they can receive. 
```javascript
const keyPairBob1 = bitcoin.ECPair.fromWIF(bob[1].wif, network)
const p2pkhBob1 = bitcoin.payments.p2pkh({pubkey: keyPairBob1.publicKey, network})

const keyPairDave1 = bitcoin.ECPair.fromWIF(dave[1].wif, network)
const p2pkhDave1 = bitcoin.payments.p2pkh({pubkey: keyPairDave1.publicKey, network})

const keyPairMallory2 = bitcoin.ECPair.fromWIF(mallory[2].wif, network)
const p2pkhMallory2 = bitcoin.payments.p2pkh({pubkey: keyPairMallory2.publicKey, network})

const keyPairAlice2 = bitcoin.ECPair.fromWIF(alice[2].wif, network)
const p2pkhAlice2 = bitcoin.payments.p2pkh({pubkey: keyPairAlice2.publicKey, network})
```

We also have two more recipients that will get back their change (eve_1 and mallory_1).
```javascript
const p2pkhEve1 = bitcoin.payments.p2pkh({pubkey: keyPairEve1.publicKey, network})
const p2pkhMallory1 = bitcoin.payments.p2pkh({pubkey: keyPairMallory1.publicKey, network})
```

Create a BitcoinJS transaction builder object.
```javascript
const txb = new bitcoin.TransactionBuilder(network)
```

Add each inputs by providing the outpoints.
```javascript
txb.addInput('TX_ID', TX_VOUT)
txb.addInput('TX_ID', TX_VOUT)
txb.addInput('TX_ID', TX_VOUT)
txb.addInput('TX_ID', TX_VOUT)
```

Add each 0.2 BTC payment outputs.
```javascript
txb.addOutput(p2pkhBob1.address, 2e7)
txb.addOutput(p2pkhDave1.address, 2e7)
txb.addOutput(p2pkhMallory2.address, 2e7)
txb.addOutput(p2pkhAlice2.address, 2e7)
```

Add the change outputs of eve_1 and mallory_1. These UTXOs will not be coinjoined. One might reasonably assume that the
4950000 satoshis UTXO belongs to eve_1 and that the 9950000 satoshis UTXO belongs to mallory_1. 
Let's also subtract the mining fees (0.0005 BTC each) from them.
We can have different policies regarding who has to pay for the mining fees, it is just easier that way for our example.
```javascript
txb.addOutput(p2pkhEve1.address, 5e6 - 5e4)
txb.addOutput(p2pkhMallory1.address, 1e7 - 5e4)
```

> The miner fee is calculated by subtracting the outputs from the inputs.
> (20000000 + 20000000 + 25000000 + 30000000)ins - (20000000 + 20000000 + 20000000 + 20000000 + 4950000 + 9950000)outs
> = 100 000
> 100 000 satoshis equals 0,001 BTC, this is the mining fee.

Each participant signs their input with the default `SIGHASH_ALL` flag, which prevents inputs or outputs from being 
manipulated after the fact.
```javascript
txb.sign(0, keyPairAlice1)
txb.sign(1, keyPairCarol1)
txb.sign(2, keyPairEve1)
txb.sign(3, keyPairMallory1)
```

Finally we can build the transaction and get the raw hex serialization.
```javascript
const tx = txb.build()
console.log('tx.toHex()  ', tx.toHex())
```

Inspect the raw transaction with Bitcoin Core CLI, check that everything is correct.
```
$ decoderawtransaction "hexstring"
```


## Broadcasting the transaction

It's time to broadcast the transaction via Bitcoin Core CLI.
```
$ sendrawtransaction "hexstring"
```

Inspect the transaction.
> Don't forget the second argument to returns a detailed json object.
```
$ getrawtransaction "txid" true
```
